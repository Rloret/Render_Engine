# Render_Engine
Small Forward and Deferred rendering engine with support for modern graphics pipeline and compute shders. Built using freeGLUT 
 INSTRUCTIONS:
 To make the engine work you have to extract the file called ExtractOutsideProjectFolder.rar into a the parent directory of the project.
 
 TheProjectFolderName
  ->extractedrar
  ->FoldercontainingVSSolution
  
  
  The render engine is not intended to be easy to use, it is made for my research purposes so some bugs might appear, its not bulletproof
